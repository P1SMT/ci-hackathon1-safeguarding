The site is targeted for members of the UK public (non-professionals) who are seeking essential and comprehensive knowledge on understanding safeguarding, identifying abuse, current practices and available resources/pointers for raising Safeguarding incidents, so that they feel more confident when they wish to act as guardians in their community, protecting individuals from harm and abuse.
